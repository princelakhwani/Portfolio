            Iâ€™m driven by the challenge of adapting my skills, processes, and thinking to meet the
            evolving needs of the world. I excel in collaborative, ambitious teams that create
            inclusive environments where everyone feels they belong. My skills and interests cut
            across the following:
          </p>
        </div>
